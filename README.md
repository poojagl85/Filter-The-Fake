# Filter-The-Fake

Our-Idea:

If we could create a platform that could streamline several news sources,we could focus on a compare and contrast approach. Users would be able to look at the same story from different perspectives and could compare and contrast. This collection of information would allow for different perspectives on the same event. It would force consumers to take in information from a purer standpoint,breaking down their preconceived bias and building a larger picture. 
Our goal would be to change people from taking in news from sources that fit their biases and help build how they view the world,to absorbing information without said bias.


Features we will Build:-

We will Build a Web Application using different news APIâ€™s to get breaking news headlines, search for articles or blogs throughout the web.

The news will be categorised into different categories such as Technology, Sports , Politics etc.  

We will be using User Rating  based system,  As whenever a user will register to our website he/she will be asked to fill his interests and career field. Hence the news content will be filtered out according to them.

The user will be able to rate news articles  as:-
  Fake or biased.
  These ratings will be displayed to the users along with the articles.
  The user will be able to support his Rating by uploading reliable resources.  
  Also our system will use different methods to check facts in news article and flag the ones that can be fake. It will alert the   users while reading the particular articles.

Features that will be good to have :-

The user will get credits for Rating  that they can convert into real money. Credits will be provided accordingly if the user 
provides strong evidences and reliable sources he will get more credits.

Similar to gaining credits, Users who do not fact-check but vote just to influence popular opinion can expect to lose money because others who fact-check for profit will not vote the same. 

This will stop users from voting based on their political affiliations and not according to due diligence of the facts

OUTPUT :-

The output will be a news stream that is filtered to be as credible as possible because it leverages self-interest in humans. I believe this is the best way to fight fake news.
